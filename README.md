 # GEAR_BOX_PROJECT_KYLIAN_TECH

## Description
This project is about parking system in different modes, such as P, R, N and D.

### P - Park Gear:
"Park" is signified by the "P" in an automatic vehicle.
This mode is employed When the car is not in use or in motion.
The transmission is locked when the automobile is in park, preventing the wheels from turning.
This mode is essential for keeping the car in place, especially when you're parked on a hill or slope.

### R - Reverse Gear:
The "R" in an automatic car stands for "Reverse."
This mode is used when you want to back up your car.
When the transmission is in reverse, the car will move backward, allowing you to back out of a parking spot or driveway.

### N - Neutral Gear:
The "N" in an automatic car stands for "Neutral."
This mode is used when you want to coast without the engine driving the wheels.
For example, when you're rolling down a hill, you can put the car in neutral to save fuel.
However, be mindful that putting the car in neutral on a flat surface or uphill can result in the car rolling forward or backward,
so it's important to use the handbrake in these situations.

### D - Drive Gear:
The "D" in an automatic car stands for "Drive."
This mode is used for normal driving, where the car will automatically shift gears based on speed and power requirements.
When you're driving on the highway or cruising through the city, you'll likely have the car in drive.
